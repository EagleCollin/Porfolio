        <p class="app-page-description">
          I started this application for one main reason: I didn't like being
          restricted to how many characters I could store at one time on another
          web application.
          <br />
          This led me down the rabbit hole of "How in depth do I want to make
          this application?" That discovery process brought me to a singular
          conclusion:
          <br />
          I want this application to simplify the process for any wanna be
          Dungeons and Dragons nerd.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="subheader">Functionality</h2>
        <p class="app-page-description">
          The main sections of the application are the authorization, the api
          calls, and the actual display of the information.
          <h3 class="description-section-title">Authorization</h3>
